In the last set of exercises, you've been working with repetitions. In this lesson, we'll deepen our understanding on how the quantifiers work.

## Greedy vs. Non-greedy matching

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "d3a5d0d0b5"
```

`@part1`
- There are two types of match methods: {{1}}
    * Greedy 
    * Non-greedy or lazy 


- Standard quantifiers are greedy by default: ***, +, ?, {num, num}** {{2}}

- They can be converted to non-greedy by appending **?**: ***?, +?, ??,{num, num}?** {{3}}


`@script`
I'll start off by saying that there are two types of match methods, the greedy and the non-greedy or also called lazy operators. The quantifiers that you have been learning till now, refer as standard quantifiers are greedy by default. However, if we append a question mark to them, we can convert them into non-greedy quantifiers.

## Greedy matching

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "7a2f8a06db"
```

`@part1`
- **Greedy**: They attempt to match as many characters as possible {{1}} 

- They return the _longest match_ {{2}}

``` python 
In[1]: import re
In[2]: re.match(r'\d+', '12345bcada')

Out[1]: <_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(0, 5), match='12345'>
``` 
{{3}}

`@script`
We said that the standard quantifiers have a greedy behaviour, meaning that they will attempt to match as many characters as possible. And on doing so, they will return the longest match found with a match attempt.
Let's take a look at this code. We want to find a pattern that has one or more digits on the string displayed and our greedy quantifier will return the pattern '12345'. We can explain this in the following way: our quantifier will start by matching the first digit found, '1'. Because it is greedy, it will keep going to find 'more' digits and stop only when no more digit can be matched, returning '12345'.

## Greedy matching

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "69963d633a"
```

`@part1`
- If it has matched so many characters that can not match the rest of pattern, it will backtrack, giving up characters matched earlier one at a time and try again {{1}} 

```python  
In[1]: import re
In[2]: re.match('.*hello', 'xhelloxxxxxx')
Out[1]: <_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(0, 6), match='xhello'>
```
{{2}}

`@script`
However, there is another characteristic that we should explore. if the greedy quantifier has matched so many characters that can not match the rest of pattern, it will backtrack, giving up characters matched earlier one at a time and try again.
To make this more clear, we'll take this code as an example. We use the greedy quantifier .* to find anything, zero or more times, followed by the letters "h" "e" "l" "l" "o".
We can see here that it returns the pattern 'xhello'. So our greedy quantifier will start by matching as much as possible, the entire string. Then it tries to match the h, but there are no characters left. So it backtracks, matching one less character. Trying again. It still doesn't match the h, so it backtracks one more step repeatedly till it finally matches the h in the regex, and the rest of the characters.

## Non-greedy matching

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "635803af55"
```

`@part1`
- **Non-Greedy**: They attempt to match as few characters as needed {{1}}

- Gives the shortest match {{2}}


``` python 
In[1]: import re
In[2]: re.match(r'\d+?', '12345bcada')

Out[1]: <_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(0, 1), match='1'>
``` 
{{3}}

{{4}}


`@script`
On the contrary, non-greedy quantifiers will attempt to match as few characters as needed returning the shortest match. 
If we take the same code as before, our non-greedy quantifier will return the pattern '1'. In this case, our quantifier will start by matching the first digit found, '1'. Because it is non-greedy, it will stop there as we stated that we want 'one or more' and one is as few as needed.

## Non-greedy matching

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "ca7ee2e599"
```

`@part1`
- If it has matched so few characters that the rest of the pattern can not match, it backtracks, expand the matched character one a time and tries again. {{1}} 

```python  
In[1]: import re
In[2]: re.match('.*?hello', 'xhelloxxxxxx')
Out[1]: <_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(0, 6), match='xhello'>
```
{{3}}

`@script`
Non-greedy quantifiers also backtrack. In this case, if they has matched so few characters that the rest of the pattern can not match, they backtrack, expand the matched character one a time and try again.
Let's take the same example code as before. But we will use the lazy quantifier .*?. Interestingly, we have the same match 'xhello' as with the greedy quantifier. However, this time with a different path. 
The lazy quantifier first matches as little as possible, nothing, leaving the entire string unmatched. Then it tries to match the h, but it doesn't work. So it backtracks, matching one more character, the x. Then it tries again, this time matching the h, and afterwards, the rest of the regex.

## Let's practice!

```yaml
type: "FinalSlide"
key: "d0ff220560"
```

`@script`
Now you have a good idea on how a greedy and lazy quantifiers work. It's your time to put this into practice.
